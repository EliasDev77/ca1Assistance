# Project Title

This was my first serious project i've ever made. this software was made using java 8. to track the student attendance. the requirements were: 1- being able to control/register all the classes in each block 2- being able to control/register all the teachers in their schedule. 3- all the data recorded have to be in one database. 4- each watchman must have installed in their computers to record the daily data. 5- The system should be able to create a report in pdf (i didn't enought time to do this feature, so it's not completed .)

the first approach i had was to create a website within an intranet in the school, a central server and a database, the schoold had the infrastructure but i wasn't allowed to use it. so i decided to build a program with java(the only language i knew pretty well back then), with all the UI to register and record the data from "users". it worked pretty well, but it could have been better. I was a student from that school situated in my country. It was my last year there so we had to show some project about programming, etc.
btw the code is horrible. but with this project i venture myself into learning better practices and design patterns, etc
